 Julia code for evaluation of the dilogarithm function. The method is
 based on "The binomial transform of p-recursive sequences and 
 dilogarithm function," [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.06928.pdf) by Stephanie Harshbarger and Barton Willis. See also _Applications and Applied Mathematics_, vol. 15, Issue 2 (December 2020), pp. 1025â€“1031
